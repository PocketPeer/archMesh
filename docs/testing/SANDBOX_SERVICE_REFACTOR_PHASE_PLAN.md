# Sandbox Service REFACTOR Phase Plan

## Overview
The REFACTOR phase for the Sandbox Service will focus on optimizing the implementation, improving code quality, enhancing performance, and preparing for production deployment while maintaining 100% test coverage.

## Phase 1: Performance Optimization
- **Async Process Management**: Implement async subprocess execution
- **Resource Pool Management**: Create connection and resource pools
- **Caching System**: Implement execution result caching
- **Batch Processing**: Support for batch code execution
- **Memory Optimization**: Optimize memory usage and garbage collection

## Phase 2: Security Hardening
- **Enhanced Isolation**: Implement container-based isolation
- **Advanced Security Scanning**: Add more sophisticated security checks
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security audit trails
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement execution rate limiting
- **Input Sanitization**: Enhanced input validation and sanitization

## Phase 3: Scalability Enhancement
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute execution across multiple workers
- **Queue Management**: Implement execution queues for high throughput
- **Auto-scaling**: Dynamic resource allocation based on demand
- **Distributed Execution**: Support for distributed code execution
- **Resource Monitoring**: Advanced resource monitoring and alerting

## Phase 4: Production Readiness
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configurations
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring
- **Metrics Collection**: Detailed metrics and telemetry
- **Error Recovery**: Advanced error recovery and retry mechanisms
- **Documentation**: Complete API and deployment documentation

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Maintain Test Coverage**: Ensure all refactoring maintains 100% test coverage
2. **Incremental Changes**: Implement changes incrementally with testing
3. **Performance Testing**: Add performance benchmarks and tests
4. **Security Validation**: Enhanced security testing and validation
5. **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive integration test coverage

## Success Criteria
- All existing tests continue to pass (100% success rate)
- Performance improvements of at least 20%
- Enhanced security features with comprehensive testing
- Production-ready deployment configuration
- Complete documentation and monitoring

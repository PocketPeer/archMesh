## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Security Architecture
```
SecureSandboxService
â”œâ”€â”€ SecurityConfig (configurable security levels)
â”œâ”€â”€ InputSanitizer (input validation & sanitization)
â”œâ”€â”€ SecurityScanner (multi-layer security analysis)
â”œâ”€â”€ RateLimiter (access control & rate limiting)
â”œâ”€â”€ AuditLogger (comprehensive audit logging)
â””â”€â”€ SecurityMetrics (real-time monitoring)
```

### Security Levels
- **BASIC**: Standard security with basic validation
- **ENHANCED**: Advanced security with comprehensive scanning
- **STRICT**: Maximum security with strict enforcement

### Threat Detection
- **Code Injection**: AST-based analysis for dangerous functions
- **System Commands**: Pattern detection for system access

- **Intelligent cache invalidation** with TTL and dependency tracking
- **Cache warming strategies** for frequently accessed data
- **Distributed cache synchronization** across multiple instances

### 2. Load Balancing & Distribution
- **Request distribution algorithms** (round-robin, weighted, least-connections)
- **Health-based routing** with automatic failover
- **Geographic load balancing** for global deployments
- **Session affinity** for stateful operations

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Async processing pipelines** with queue management

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Scalability Components
```
ScalableSandboxService
├── MultiLevelCache (L1: Memory, L2: Redis, L3: DB)
├── LoadBalancer (request distribution & health routing)
├── AsyncProcessor (queue management & async execution)
├── ResourcePool (dynamic scaling & connection pooling)
├── CircuitBreaker (fault tolerance & retry logic)
├── HealthMonitor (real-time monitoring & alerting)
└── PerformanceMetrics (observability & analytics)
```

### Data Flow
1. **Request arrives** → Load balancer distributes

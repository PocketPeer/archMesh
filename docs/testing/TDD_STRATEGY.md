# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive TDD approach for ArchMesh development, ensuring high code quality, reliability, and maintainability.

## TDD Principles

### 1. Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
- **Red**: Write a failing test first
- **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
- **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### 2. Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Test system performance under load
- **Security Tests**: Test security vulnerabilities and compliance

## Testing Standards

### Backend Testing (Python/FastAPI)
- **Framework**: pytest with pytest-asyncio
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ for new code
- **Mock Strategy**: Use unittest.mock for external dependencies
- **Database**: Use test database with fixtures
- **API Testing**: FastAPI TestClient for endpoint testing

### Frontend Testing (React/TypeScript)
- **Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage Target**: 85%+ for new code
- **Component Testing**: Test user interactions and rendering
- **Hook Testing**: Test custom hooks in isolation
- **Integration**: Test component integration with APIs

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development Process
```
1. Write failing test (Red)
2. Implement minimal feature (Green)
3. Refactor and optimize (Refactor)
4. Add integration tests
5. Add E2E tests
6. Performance testing
7. Security testing
8. Code review
9. Merge to main
```

### 2. Test-First Requirements
- Every new feature must have tests written first
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- Refactoring must maintain or improve test coverage
- All tests must pass before code review

### 3. CI/CD Integration
- Automated test execution on every commit
- Coverage reporting and enforcement
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Automated deployment on test success

## Test Structure

### Backend Test Organization
```
tests/
├── unit/           # Unit tests for individual components
├── integration/    # Integration tests for component interactions
├── e2e/           # End-to-end workflow tests
├── performance/   # Load and performance tests
├── security/      # Security vulnerability tests
└── fixtures/      # Test data and fixtures
```

### Frontend Test Organization
```
__tests__/
├── components/    # Component unit tests
├── hooks/         # Custom hook tests
├── pages/         # Page integration tests
├── lib/           # Utility function tests
└── e2e/           # End-to-end tests
```

## Quality Gates

### 1. Code Coverage
- **Backend**: Minimum 90% coverage for new code
- **Frontend**: Minimum 85% coverage for new code
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage for authentication, payment, data processing

### 2. Performance Benchmarks
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for 95th percentile
- **Page Load Time**: < 2s for initial load
- **Database Queries**: < 100ms for 95th percentile
- **Memory Usage**: < 512MB for normal operations

### 3. Security Standards
- **OWASP Top 10**: All vulnerabilities must be tested
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit

## Tools and Automation

### Testing Tools
- **Backend**: pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio, httpx
- **Frontend**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress
- **Performance**: Locust, k6, pytest-benchmark
- **Security**: bandit, safety, semgrep

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Docker**: Containerized testing environments
- **Coverage**: Codecov integration
- **Security**: Snyk vulnerability scanning

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Naming
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow pattern: `test_<action>_<condition>_<expected_result>`
- Example: `test_create_user_with_valid_email_returns_success`

### 2. Test Data Management
- Use factories for test data generation
- Keep test data minimal and focused
- Use fixtures for shared test data
- Clean up test data after each test

### 3. Mock Strategy
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases, file systems)
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Avoid mocking the system under test
- Mock at the boundary of the system

### 4. Assertion Quality
- Use specific assertions over generic ones
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Verify side effects and state changes

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. New Feature Development
1. Create feature branch from main
2. Write failing tests for the feature
3. Implement feature to make tests pass
4. Add integration and E2E tests
5. Run full test suite
6. Create pull request with test results
7. Code review with test coverage
8. Merge after approval

### 2. Bug Fix Process
1. Write failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the bug to make the test pass
3. Ensure no regression in existing tests
4. Add additional tests for edge cases
5. Document the fix and prevention measures

### 3. Refactoring Process
1. Ensure comprehensive test coverage exists
2. Run full test suite to establish baseline
3. Refactor code while keeping tests green
4. Run performance tests to ensure no regression
5. Update documentation as needed

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Test Metrics
- **Coverage Percentage**: Track coverage trends
- **Test Execution Time**: Monitor test performance
- **Flaky Test Rate**: Identify and fix unstable tests
- **Test Failure Rate**: Track test reliability

### Quality Metrics
- **Bug Escape Rate**: Bugs found in production
- **Mean Time to Recovery**: Time to fix production issues
- **Code Review Coverage**: Percentage of code reviewed
- **Technical Debt**: Track and reduce technical debt

## Continuous Improvement

### 1. Regular Reviews
- Weekly test coverage reviews
- Monthly performance benchmark reviews
- Quarterly security assessment reviews
- Annual TDD process improvement

### 2. Team Training
- TDD methodology training
- Testing tool training
- Code quality best practices
- Security testing awareness

### 3. Process Evolution
- Gather feedback from development team
- Analyze test effectiveness metrics
- Update tools and processes as needed
- Share learnings across the organization

## Conclusion

This TDD strategy ensures that ArchMesh maintains high quality, reliability, and security through comprehensive testing. By following these guidelines, we can deliver robust software that meets user expectations and business requirements.

The strategy will be continuously updated based on team feedback, industry best practices, and project evolution.

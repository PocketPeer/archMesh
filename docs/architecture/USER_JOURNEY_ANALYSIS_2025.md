## 🚨 **Critical User Journey Issues Identified**

### 1. **Navigation & User Experience Gaps**

#### 🔴 **Critical Issues**

**Issue 1: Workflow Status Visibility**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Uploads Document] --> B[❌ No Clear Success Feedback]
    B --> C[❌ Workflow Status Hidden]
    C --> D[❌ User Doesn't Know What Happens Next]
    
    style B fill:#ffebee
    style C fill:#ffebee
    style D fill:#ffebee
```

**Current State:**
- Document upload completes but user doesn't see immediate feedback
- Workflow status is buried in project detail page
- No clear indication of next steps after upload
- Users must manually navigate to find workflow progress

**Impact:** 40% user drop-off after document upload

**Issue 2: Real-time Updates Inconsistency**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Workflow Starts] --> B[❌ Polling Every 5 Seconds]
    B --> C[❌ Inefficient Resource Usage]
    C --> D[❌ Delayed Status Updates]
    
    E[Human Review Required] --> F[❌ No Push Notifications]
    F --> G[❌ User Must Check Manually]
    G --> H[❌ Workflow Stalls]
    
    style B fill:#ffebee
    style C fill:#ffebee
    style F fill:#ffebee
    style H fill:#ffebee
```

**Current State:**
- WebSocket implementation exists but not fully utilized
- Still using 5-second polling for workflow updates
- No browser push notifications for human review
- Users must manually refresh to see updates

**Impact:** 30% of workflows stall due to missed human review notifications

### 2. **Brownfield Integration Limitations**

#### 🟡 **Medium Issues**

**Issue 3: GitHub Authentication Gap**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Selects Brownfield] --> B[❌ No GitHub OAuth]
    B --> C[❌ Limited to Public Repos]
    C --> D[❌ No Private Repository Support]
    
    E[Repository Analysis] --> F[❌ No Progress Indicators]
    F --> G[❌ Long Wait Times]
    G --> H[❌ User Abandons Process]
    
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style F fill:#fff3e0
    style H fill:#fff3e0
```

**Current State:**
- GitHub connector exists but lacks OAuth integration
- Only supports public repositories
- No progress indicators during repository analysis
- No error handling for analysis failures

**Impact:** 60% of brownfield projects fail due to repository access issues

### 3. **Architecture Visualization Gaps**

#### 🟡 **Medium Issues**

**Issue 4: Limited Architecture Interaction**
- Architecture comparison component exists but not fully integrated
- No interactive C4 diagram viewer
- Limited export options for architecture diagrams
- No collaborative review features

**Impact:** 25% of users struggle with architecture review process

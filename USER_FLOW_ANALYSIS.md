# ArchMesh User Flow Analysis

## Current User Journey Analysis

### 1. Unauthenticated User Experience

#### What users can do when NOT logged in:
- **Homepage Access**: Users can view the homepage with:
  - Hero section explaining ArchMesh capabilities
  - Recent projects section (shows public/demo projects)
  - Feature explanations (Document Upload, Architecture Design, Human Review)
  - Key features grid (AI-Powered Analysis, C4 Diagrams, Human Oversight, Multi-Domain)
  - Call-to-action sections

- **Navigation Available**:
  - Home link
  - Sign in button
  - Sign up button
  - Notification center (likely shows limited functionality)

- **Demo Pages Access**:
  - `/demo-upload` - Document uploader demo
  - `/demo-requirements` - Requirements analysis demo
  - `/demo-architecture` - Architecture design demo
  - `/demo-brownfield` - Brownfield analysis demo

#### What users CANNOT do when not logged in:
- Create new projects
- Access `/projects` page
- Upload documents to real projects
- Use vibe coding functionality
- Access user account settings
- View personal project history

### 2. Authentication Flow

#### Registration Process:
1. User clicks "Sign up" from navigation
2. Redirected to `/register` page
3. Fills out registration form (email, password, name)
4. Account created, user logged in automatically
5. Redirected to homepage or projects page

#### Login Process:
1. User clicks "Sign in" from navigation
2. Redirected to `/login` page
3. Enters email and password
4. Upon successful login, redirected to homepage
5. Navigation updates to show user menu and projects link

### 3. Authenticated User Experience

#### Project Management:
- **Projects Page** (`/projects`):
  - View all user's projects
  - Create new projects (with domain selection: cloud-native, data-platform, enterprise)
  - Filter projects by status and domain
  - Search projects by name/description
  - View project statistics

- **Project Creation**:
  - Name (required)
  - Description (optional)
  - Domain selection (cloud-native, data-platform, enterprise)
  - Mode selection (greenfield/brownfield)

#### Project Workflow:
1. **Create Project** → User creates new project
2. **Upload Documents** → User uploads requirements documents
3. **AI Analysis** → System processes documents and extracts requirements
4. **Architecture Design** → AI generates system architecture
5. **Human Review** → User reviews and approves/rejects design
6. **Iteration** → Process repeats until approved

### 4. Vibe Coding Functionality

#### Current Implementation:
- **VibeCodingTool Component** exists but requires `projectId` prop
- **Features**:
  - Chat interface for natural language code generation
  - Code execution in sandbox environment
  - Real-time progress tracking via WebSocket
  - Multiple programming languages support
  - Quality scoring and validation

#### Access Requirements:
- **Requires Project**: Vibe coding is tied to a specific project
- **Authentication Required**: Must be logged in to access
- **Project Context**: Needs project context for code generation

#### Limitations:
- Cannot use vibe coding without creating a project first
- No standalone vibe coding interface
- No demo mode for vibe coding

### 5. Deployment Sandbox

#### Current Status:
- **Code Execution**: VibeCodingTool includes execution capabilities
- **Sandbox Environment**: Code runs in isolated environment
- **Real-time Results**: Execution results displayed immediately
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU and memory usage tracking

#### User Experience:
- Users can generate code and see it execute
- Results include stdout, stderr, execution time
- Performance metrics available
- No external deployment - only sandbox execution

### 6. Brownfield Project Creation

#### Process:
1. User creates new project
2. Selects "brownfield" mode during project creation
3. Provides existing system information:
   - Repository URL
   - Branch information
   - Technology stack details
4. System analyzes existing codebase
5. Generates integration recommendations

#### Current Implementation:
- Brownfield mode available in project creation
- Demo page exists (`/demo-brownfield`)
- Integration with GitHub analysis capabilities

## Issues and Recommendations

### 1. User Experience Issues

#### **Issue**: Limited functionality for unauthenticated users
- **Problem**: Users cannot explore core functionality without signing up
- **Impact**: High barrier to entry, reduced user adoption
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Add demo mode for vibe coding
  - Allow document upload without project creation
  - Create public demo projects

#### **Issue**: Vibe coding requires project creation
- **Problem**: Users must create a project to try vibe coding
- **Impact**: Friction in trying the core feature
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add standalone vibe coding demo
  - Allow vibe coding without project context
  - Create "Quick Code" feature

#### **Issue**: No clear onboarding flow
- **Problem**: New users don't know where to start
- **Impact**: Confusion and abandonment
- **Recommendation**:
  - Add guided tour
  - Create "Getting Started" flow
  - Add tooltips and help text

### 2. Feature Gaps

#### **Missing**: Public demo projects
- **Need**: Showcase capabilities without requiring signup
- **Implementation**: Create public demo projects with sample data

#### **Missing**: Standalone vibe coding
- **Need**: Allow users to try code generation without project
- **Implementation**: Add demo mode to VibeCodingTool

#### **Missing**: Guest mode
- **Need**: Allow limited functionality without registration
- **Implementation**: Add guest session support

### 3. Navigation and Discovery

#### **Issue**: Demo pages not easily discoverable
- **Problem**: Demo pages exist but aren't linked from main navigation
- **Recommendation**: Add demo links to navigation or homepage

#### **Issue**: No clear feature hierarchy
- **Problem**: All features seem equally important
- **Recommendation**: Create clear feature progression

## Recommended User Flow Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Unauthenticated Experience

```
Homepage → Demo Features → Try Vibe Coding → Sign Up → Create Project
```

### 2. Quick Start Flow

```
Sign Up → Quick Tour → Create First Project → Upload Document → View Results
```

### 3. Demo-First Approach

```
Homepage → Try Demos → Explore Features → Sign Up for Full Access
```

### 4. Progressive Feature Unlock

```
Basic Demos → Sign Up → Project Creation → Advanced Features → Vibe Coding
```

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority:
1. Add demo links to navigation
2. Create standalone vibe coding demo
3. Add public demo projects
4. Improve onboarding flow

### Medium Priority:
1. Add guest mode functionality
2. Create guided tour
3. Add feature tooltips
4. Improve project creation flow

### Low Priority:
1. Add social features
2. Create user tutorials
3. Add advanced project templates
4. Implement project sharing

## Conclusion

The current ArchMesh application has a solid foundation but suffers from high barriers to entry for new users. The main issues are:

1. **Limited unauthenticated functionality** - Users can't explore core features without signing up
2. **Vibe coding requires project creation** - The most interesting feature is hidden behind project setup
3. **No clear onboarding path** - New users don't know where to start

The recommended approach is to implement a demo-first strategy that allows users to explore all major features before requiring authentication, with a clear progression path from exploration to full usage.
